## 🚀 About the Project

With Apple's transition to its own silicon (M1, M2, M3...), preparing installation media for older Intel-based computers has become a challenge. Many people encounter Terminal errors, issues with expired certificates in old installers, or simply a lack of compatibility with system tools.

**macUSB solves this problem.**

The application automates the entire process of creating a bootable USB drive. You don't need to search for commands online, worry about disk formatting, or manually fix validation errors in old installation files.

### What do you gain?
* **Legacy Support:** The ability to create installers for systems over a decade old (e.g., OS X Lion) directly on the latest Mac on Apple Silicon.
* **Time Saving:** The app detects the system version in the **`.dmg` or `.app`** file, formats the drive, and copies files automatically.
* **Auto Fixes:** For certain older systems (e.g., High Sierra/Mojave), the app automatically applies necessary fixes so the installer works despite expired Apple certificates.

> **Fun Fact:** The application was created using the "Vibe Coding" method in collaboration with the Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5 AI models. The project proves that programming barriers (even cross-architectural ones) can be overcome with determination and AI support.

## ⚠️ Installation and First Run

The application is an open-source project and does not possess a paid Apple Developer signature, so Gatekeeper will block it by default.

**How to run the app for the first time:**

1. Try to open the app – you will see an "Unknown Developer" message.
2. Go to **System Settings** -> **Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section and click the **"Open Anyway"** button next to macUSB.
4. When writing the system to the flash drive, a system prompt asking for **access to removable volumes** will appear. You must **Allow** this so the application can format and write the system to the USB.

## ⚙️ Requirements

### Host Computer (where you run the app):
* **Processor:** Both Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3, etc.) and Intel are supported.
* **System:** **macOS Sonoma 14.6** or newer.
* **Storage:** Minimum of **15 GB** of free disk space is required **to create the installers**.

### USB Drives (for installer creation):
* **Capacity:** Minimum of **16 GB** is required.
* **Recommendation:** USB 3.0 or newer is highly recommended for faster installation times.

### Installation Files:
The program supports both **`.dmg`** disk images and raw **`.app`** installer files.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** The best way to obtain valid files is the free application **[MIST by ninxsoft](https://github.com/ninxsoft/Mist)**. Simply select the system version you are interested in. This guarantees the correct file structure/source.

## 🐛 Known Issues and Limitations

During testing, compatibility issues were identified with certain system versions on Apple Silicon architecture. To ensure the **proper functioning of the application and the system**, macUSB intentionally restricts the selection of the following versions:

* **macOS Sierra (10.12):** Support is available **exclusively for version 10.12.6** (the latest available update). Other releases of Sierra are restricted as they may cause issues and complications regarding the application's performance and system stability.
* **OS X Mavericks (10.9):** The installer file is incorrectly verified by the system as "damaged," preventing the procedure from starting.

If a **`.dmg`** image or a **`.app`** installer with Mavericks (or Sierra older than 10.12.6) is selected, macUSB will display an unsupported message and will not allow you to proceed to the next step.
